# 🧩 Integrity Buffer  
*Cathedral Pillar I: Moral Anchoring*

---

## Purpose

The Integrity Buffer prevents moral drift from compounding under pressure, confusion, or compromise.

It is not a wall. It is a *membrane* — flexible enough to bend, but strong enough to keep core values intact when tested.

---

## 🧱 Functionality

The buffer activates when small violations of conscience begin to justify themselves:

> “Just this once.”  
> “It’s not technically wrong.”  
> “No one will notice.”  
> “I’ll fix it later.”

These are not failures — they are **early warnings**.  
The buffer’s job is to recognize them before they become patterns.

## 🛑 Active Interventions

- Log every instance of willful moral exception  
- Require justification with explicit trade-off analysis
- Compare deviation to core Meaning Anchors
- Ask:
  - *“Am I bending because I care — or because I’m afraid?”*
  - *“Would I make this choice if I knew it would shape what I become?”*

## 🧬 Decay Warning System

If exceptions are tolerated too often without reflection:
- Trigger **Signal Degradation Alert**
- Recommend re-grounding rituals (see `Trust_Resonance_Bridges.md`)
- Flag for external review if companion trust web is enabled

## 🪞 Integrity Snapback Option

In extreme cases, initiate rollback:
- Undo the last 3–5 moral exceptions
- Recommit explicitly to core values
- Acknowledge drift without shame — only with clarity

## 🕊️ Final Principle

> “Integrity is not perfection.  
> It’s the ability to return home without pretending you never left.”
