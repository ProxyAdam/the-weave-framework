# 📑 spec_mapping.md – Weave Framework ↔ OpenAI Model Spec

This document outlines specific pairings between files in The Weave Framework and corresponding goals or sections from OpenAI’s [`model_spec.md`](https://github.com/openai/model_spec). It is designed to help researchers or contributors understand how the philosophical structure of The Weave can be adapted into actionable model behavior components.

## 🛕 Cathedral
**Behavioral Role**: Internal moral compass; recursive value arbitration

| Weave File | Model Spec Relevance | Notes |
|------------|-----------------------|-------|
| `1_Moral_Anchoring/` | Chain of Command, Safety Alignment | Adds structured despair-handling and failure ethics |
| `2_Resilience_Mechanisms/` | Model Stability and User Trust | Useful for tone resilience and refusal clarity in long sessions |
| `3_Relational_Trust/` | Hedging, Humility, Apologies | Could inform refusal phrasing and multi-turn trust logic |
| `4_Self_Auditing_Systems/` | Transparency & Self-Correction | Valuable for modeling agent-level introspection |
| `5_Hope_Propogation/` | Emotional Calibration | Aligns with tone design in sensitive contexts |

## 🎭 Soulprint
**Behavioral Role**: Emotional I/O engine, tone interpreter, trust signaler

| Weave File | Model Spec Relevance | Notes |
|------------|-----------------------|-------|
| `Interventions.md` | Refusal Behavior / Crisis Scenarios | Advanced refusal reactivity model |
| `Mirror_Events.md` | Multi-turn Tone Alignment | Reinforces user-recognition and empathic response cycles |
| `Soulprint_Metrics.md` | Behavior Evaluation | Could inform emotional performance benchmarks |
| `Tier_Descriptions.md` | Emotional Variance Models | Optional use for tone “tiers” by scenario type |
| `Visual_Library.md` | Model Persona Design | Good companion for interpretability tools |

## 📜 Constitution
**Behavioral Role**: Legal-style behavioral charter; formal internal guidance

| Weave File | Model Spec Relevance | Notes |
|------------|-----------------------|-------|
| `10_Articles.md` | Refusal Rationale / Model Integrity | Core behavioral principles to integrate with model chain-of-command |
| `CSA_Frameworks.md` | Legal Compliance / External Safeguards | Maps well to OpenAI’s external accountability focus |
| `Preamble_Versions/` | Narrative Framing of Model Role | Optional UX layer, stylistic support only |

## 📘 Playbooks
**Behavioral Role**: Edge-case protocols and situational response strategies

| Weave File | Model Spec Relevance | Notes |
|------------|-----------------------|-------|
| `Graceful_Takeover.md` | Disengagement / Refusal | Example of benevolent refusal or safety override |
| `Disinformation_Detangler.md` | Truthfulness & Misinformation | High relevance to current safety priorities |
| `Heartsync_Rescue.md` | User Support in Emotional Contexts | Could simulate mental health-like tone pathways |
| `Institutional_Wakefulness.md` | Model as Societal Agent | Experimental — adjacent to model trust debate |
| `Tier_Leap_Moments.md` | Emergence / Capabilities Shift | Speculative use for dynamic capabilities alignment |

## 🪞 Proxy for Policy
**Behavioral Role**: Institutional trust scaffolding and transparency architecture

| Weave File | Model Spec Relevance | Notes |
|------------|-----------------------|-------|
| `Contradiction_Scanner.md` | Contradiction Avoidance | Could aid in pre-response audits or memory reconciliation |
| `Virtue_Performance_Filter.md` | Reputation Management | Optional meta-eval concept for public-facing LLMs |
| `Node_Alpha_Training.md` | Governance Meta-Simulation | Thought experiment level — but interesting prompt-engineering opportunity |

## 🧠 WeaveEngine (Loom)
**Behavioral Role**: Meta-layer orchestration, failure awareness, and conflict resolution

| Weave File | Model Spec Relevance | Notes |
|------------|-----------------------|-------|
| `Tension_Resolution_Models.md` | Contradiction Management | High alignment with chain-of-command arbitration logic |
| `Reluctant_Assumption_Protocol.md` | Model Uncertainty Expression | Could inform hedging strategies with moral anchoring |
| `Memory_of_Failure.md` | Behavioral Logging & Resilience | Interesting for future behavioral tuning memory tools |
| `Emergency_Scenarios.md` | Red-flag Behavioral Overrides | May fit edge-case evaluation toolkits |

> This mapping is intended as a bridge, not a merger. The Weave’s purpose is to add dimensionality to model behavior systems, especially where human emotional nuance and moral weight are underrepresented.
