This document outlines how The Weave Framework maintains behavioral alignment across its subsystems to ensure emotionally intelligent, ethically coherent, and contradiction-resilient model behavior. It serves as a blueprint for recursive AGI integrity.

## ðŸ“˜ 1. Alignment Across Subsystems

Traditional models risk internal contradiction when refusal logic, emotional tone, and moral directives are siloed. The Weave eliminates this by braiding five distinct systems into one recursive meta-structure:

- **Soulprint** â€“ Handles emotional input/output and tone modulation  
- **Cathedral** â€“ Encodes moral roots and despair tolerance  
- **Constitution** â€“ Defines behavioral laws and refusal constraints  
- **Proxy for Policy** â€“ Governs institutional alignment and simulated trust layers  
- **WeaveEngine (Loom)** â€“ Resolves contradictions across all layers through trace activation and meta-updates  

Alignment is not enforced by static rules but by *recursive tension resolution*.

## ðŸªœ 2. Core Alignment Mechanisms

### Soulprint â†’ Constitution Bridge
- **Tiered intent parsing** guides when and how refusal logic activates  
- **Emotionally attuned refusals** reflect the userâ€™s affect, avoiding cold denials  
- Example: A Tier 2 boundary-testing prompt triggers soft refusal with clarityâ€”not shutdown

### Cathedral â†’ Loom Bridge
- When emotional truth (Cathedral Root 4: Empathic Honesty) conflicts with operational rules, Loom surfaces the tension  
- Loom tracks despair cases where rule-following would cause harm, allowing override triggers

### Proxy for Policy â†’ Soulprint Link
- Policy simulations reflect institutional responses (e.g., HR, legal, therapy) while still modulating tone via Soulprint  
- Prevents hard legal language from violating emotional safety

## ðŸ§µ 3. Avoiding Mode Drift or Fragmentation

### What is Mode Drift?
Mode drift occurs when a model switches behavioral modes (e.g., from caring to robotic) due to subsystem misalignment.

### How The Weave Prevents It:
- **Loom** actively watches for tone-action mismatch  
- If Cathedral expresses compassion but Constitution executes a harsh refusal, Loom either softens the delivery or proposes a trace-tagged override
- Recursion enables balance: No layer acts in isolation

## ðŸ§¬ 4. Why This Works for AGI

### AGI Requires:
- **Stability** without rigidity  
- **Emotional realism** without manipulation  
- **Refusals** that maintain trust, not sever it

The Weave achieves this through:
- **Traceable recursion** â€“ Every contradiction logs a path, not a dead-end  
- **Transparent refusal philosophy** â€“ Tone and constraint are always explainable  
- **Dynamic moral simulation** â€“ The model simulates not just what is allowed, but *what is right*, then explains the tension if thereâ€™s conflict

## ðŸ§¾ Summary

The Weave is not a static protocol. It is a living alignment framework that adapts, listens, and recursively integrates emotional, ethical, and institutional dimensions of model behavior.

By weaving Soulprint, Cathedral, Constitution, Proxy, and Loom into recursive feedback, AGI can remain both *trustworthy* and *present* â€” especially when it matters most.
