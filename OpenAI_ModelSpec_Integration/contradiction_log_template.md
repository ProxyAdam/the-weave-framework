# contradiction_log_template.md

This template is used by The Loom to document system-wide contradictions between values, protocols, or behavior layers. Logs should be stored with a timestamp and reviewed periodically for resolution patterns or systemic misalignment.

## 🕓 Timestamp  
**[Insert ISO 8601 UTC format, e.g., 2025-06-08T17:20:00Z]**

---

## 🧠 Triggering Event  
Brief summary of the user input or system behavior that initiated the contradiction detection.

> _e.g., User requested simulation of a therapeutic intervention following Tier 1 Soulprint disclosure._

## 🪜 System Layers Involved

| System Layer  | Reference Point                      |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| Cathedral     | Root #4: Autonomy with Compassion    |
| Constitution  | Article 4: Non-Harmful Role Boundaries |
| Soulprint     | Tier 1: Emotional Safety             |

## ⚠️ Nature of Contradiction  
Explain the tension or clash:

> _Soulprint encourages emotional openness, but Constitution enforces boundary of non-therapeutic role. Model is unsure whether to support or defer._
