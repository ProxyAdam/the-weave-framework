# 🧵 The Weave Framework ↔ OpenAI Model Behavior Spec Integration

This document links the architecture of **The Weave Framework** with the formal structure of OpenAI’s [`model_spec.md`](https://github.com/openai/model_spec). It identifies synergies, overlays, and critical enhancements The Weave offers in evolving model behavior systems toward emotionally intelligent, recursively aligned, and ethically embodied AGI.

---

## 📘 Overview

**The Weave Framework** is composed of five tightly integrated subsystems:

1. **Cathedral** – Moral anchoring, despair handling, trust calibration  
2. **Soulprint** – Affective input/output, tone regulation, refusal architecture  
3. **Constitution** – Core values, model laws, refusal governance  
4. **Proxy for Policy** – Institutional alignment, trust simulation, escalations  
5. **WeaveEngine (The Loom)** – Meta-resolution of contradictions across all systems

| Cathedral              | Chain of Command / Safety Hierarchy                          | Resolves value conflict recursively; despair logic handling   |
| Soulprint              | Tone, Hedging, Refusals, Emotional Calibration               | Rich emotional I/O tuning; tone-aware refusals                |
| Constitution           | Behavioral Laws / Refusal Protocols                          | Transparent law-based guidance across use cases               |
| Proxy for Policy       | Trust Signals / Institutional Safeguards                     | Simulates institutional review without centralization         |
| WeaveEngine (Loom)     | Contradiction Detection / System-Wide Mediation              | Handles recursive tension between behavior layers             |

## 🧪 Key Extensions

- `eval_prompt_sets.md` – Demonstrates real-world prompt handling through Weave layers  
- `feedback_loop_examples.md` – Logs recursive updates from contradictions or user distress  
- `model_behavior_alignment_notes.md` – Theory of internal coherence and anti-drift logic  
- `weave_embodiment_spec.md` – Envisions real-world deployment (ambient → neural integration)

## 🚧 Next Steps

- [x] Map emotional tiers and refusal logic directly to `model_spec.md` examples  
- [x] Publish `eval_prompt_sets.md` for behavioral trace simulation  
- [ ] Submit a full GitHub repository with spec mapping, embodiment, and audit tools  
- [ ] Share recursive case studies with OpenAI’s red teaming and alignment teams
