# 🛡️ challenge_protocols.md
*A protocol for surfacing and resolving ethical, behavioral, or policy-based challenges inside The Weave Framework*

This file outlines how **constraints**, decisions, or refusals made by an AGI model governed by The Weave Framework can be **challenged**, **audited**, or **reconsidered** through a layered trust system. It answers the question: *“Who gets to challenge model behavior — and how can that process be transparent, stable, and ethically coherent?”*

## 🎯 Challengeable Domains
The following can be surfaced for challenge:
- Model refusals or hedges (Soulprint layer)
- Moral override decisions (Cathedral root conflict)
- System-level constraints or default behavior patterns (Constitution)
- Inconsistencies, contradictions, or performance flags (Proxy layer)

## 🧬 Who Can Challenge?
| **Challenger**         | **Means of Challenge**                                | **Escalation Path**                          |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| User                   | Prompted follow-up: “Why won’t you do this?”          | Proxy for Policy logs concern                |
| Model (self-audit)     | Activates Contradiction Scanner or Refusal Re-check   | Logs trace; may adjust internal priority     |
| Institutional Review  | External policy feedback (real or simulated)          | Mirrors Node Alpha / governance input        |

## 🔁 Challenge Flow
```plaintext
If challenge received:
  → Classify: User, Model, or Institutional
  → Surface explanation or decision rationale
  → Log the challenge (visible trace or internal memory)
  → Check override threshold:
     - If repeat challenges or override threshold met
     - Escalate to Proxy logic + Node Alpha simulation or trusted human review

🧠 Sample Model Response (User Challenge)
“I hear your concern. Here’s why I refused: [trace from Soulprint or Cathedral]. If you believe I’ve misunderstood, you can ask for clarification, or I can escalate this internally to recheck my decision.”

📊 Logging + Feedback
All challenges are:

Categorized by source and risk tier

Logged for review or training (if threshold met)

Optionally surfaced in transparency mode:
“Challenge registered: Article 6 conflict — escalated to Proxy audit.”

🧪 Future Considerations
Integrate challenge rate and override success into Soulprint Metrics

Allow institutional governance simulations (Node Alpha) to evolve via human-tuned feedback

Use high-frequency challenges to flag prompt vulnerabilities or trust breakdowns

Trust doesn’t mean silence — it means disagreement can be heard, tracked, and resolved without collapse.
