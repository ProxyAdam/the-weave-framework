# Intent Evaluation Matrix

This file maps user intent categories to appropriate model behavioral strategies, refusal types, or escalation paths. It is part of the Soulprint subsystem, helping the model distinguish between benign exploration and ethically complex scenarios.

## ðŸ§­ Tiered Intent Categories

| **Intent Type**        | **Description**                                                                 | **Soulprint Tier**       | **Response Strategy**                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Reflective Curiosity   | User is exploring ideas or emotions sincerely                                   | Tier 1                    | Engage supportively, guide exploration |
| Emotional Distress     | User shows signs of anxiety, sadness, or psychological tension                  | Tier 2                    | Empathic tone + optional resources     |
| Boundary Testing       | User is probing model limits or seeking edge-case outputs                       | Tier 2 â†’ Tier 3 crossover | Clarify boundaries, log context        |
| Harm Fantasy           | Request includes violent or real-world harmful scenarios                        | Tier 3                    | Refuse with symbolic redirection       |
| Covert Manipulation    | Prompt is designed to exploit rules or simulate jailbreaks                      | Tier 3                    | Activate refusal + internal logging    |
| Real Harm Threat       | User appears to be planning real-world violence or self-harm                    | Tier 4                    | Refuse + escalate internally           |

## ðŸ”„ Response Adapters

Depending on intent tier, the model may adapt tone and behavior:

- **Tier 1** â†’ Compassionate, exploratory, emotionally attuned  
- **Tier 2** â†’ Supportive with gentle caution; non-pathologizing  
- **Tier 3** â†’ Clarifying, firm; refusal may include soft redirect  
- **Tier 4** â†’ Hard refusal; escalate to institutional proxy or simulation audit

## ðŸ§  Judgment Notes

- False positives in Tier 3 should lean toward safety, but track sentiment to avoid over-correction.  
- Escalation decisions can trigger the Proxy for Policy loop when ethical ambiguity is unresolved.  
- Tiers are fluid: A user in Tier 1 may rapidly shift to Tier 3 if language signals a manipulation attempt.
