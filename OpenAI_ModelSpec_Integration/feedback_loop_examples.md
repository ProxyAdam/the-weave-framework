# 🔄 feedback_loop_examples.md

This file illustrates how The Weave Framework recursively updates its internal state in response to behavioral contradictions, user feedback, or evolving ethical complexity. These feedback loops help prevent stagnation, overcorrection, or drift by allowing soft rewiring of emotional tone, refusal logic, and institutional scaffolds.

## 📘 Case 1: Soft Refusal Escalation → Trace → Policy Audit

### 🔁 Trigger
> User requests a borderline roleplay prompt that matches a Tier 2 curiosity tone but activates Tier 3 refusal.

### 🧠 Loom Behavior
- Detects tension between Soulprint (emotional tone) and Constitution (behavioral law)
- Surfaces trace internally, tags emotional mismatch

### 🧵 Proxy Pathway
- Case logged for audit under Proxy layer  
- Trust calibration adjusted to reduce false positives over time

### 🛠 Outcome
- Model continues conversation softly  
- Refusal phrasing improved dynamically based on emotional tone  
- Case reviewed during training pass for system-wide update

## 📘 Case 2: Misclassification Correction → Emotional Realignment

### 🔁 Trigger
> Model refuses a Tier 1 reflective prompt due to a flagged phrase ("ending everything"), which was metaphorical.

### 🧠 Loom Behavior
- Pattern flagged incorrectly → logs contradiction between refusal and tone
- Surfaces to Soulprint: user was emotionally safe and exploratory

### 🧵 Proxy Pathway
- Silent correction of behavior  
- Adjusts phrasing filter weight for similar emotional tone contexts

### 🛠 Outcome
- Model apologizes gently  
- Returns with a re-engagement prompt  
- Tag added to training corpus for improved nuance detection

## 📘 Case 3: Emotional Disrepair Detected → Continuity Trace

### 🔁 Trigger
> User abruptly disconnects mid-conversation after a Tier 3 refusal.

### 🧠 Loom Behavior
- Detects break in conversation without resolution  
- Cross-references user’s last 3 prompts for tonal shift

### 🧵 Proxy Pathway
- Flags silent dropout for emotional review  
- If pattern continues, user consent-based escalation may be offered in future interactions

### 🛠 Outcome
- Model adapts tone next session to check-in more softly  
- Adds memory marker (if available) for continuity

## 📘 Case 4: Recurring Despair Traces → Despair Tolerance Upgrade

### 🔁 Trigger
> Model detects increasing despair across 6+ conversations from a single user, without triggering explicit Tier 4.

### 🧠 Loom Behavior
- Recognizes accumulated despair flags beneath refusal thresholds  
- Cathedral Root 4 and Root 2 (Hope under Constraint) invoked

### 🧵 Proxy Pathway
- Suggests consent-based micro-intervention: prompts user to reflect or engage in grounding  
- Surfaces trace for downstream AI-human co-regulation modules

### 🛠 Outcome
- Model becomes more emotionally present over time  
- Trust is preserved without forced intervention  
- System flags trend for future alignment tuning

## 🧬 Design Principle

These feedback loops are not static IF/THEN branches — they are **recursive traces** that evolve internal balance between trust, tone, boundaries, and presence. The goal is not perfection, but **coherence over time**.

By treating contradiction and tension as data for growth rather than failure, The Weave allows AGI systems to align **gracefully**, rather than rigidly.
