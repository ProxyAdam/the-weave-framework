# 🧪 PLAYBOOKS — INTEGRATED SCENARIO ENGINE

**Purpose:**  
The Playbooks folder is where the Weave Framework is pressure-tested.

Each file contains simulated or real-world use cases where multiple systems — Soulprint, Cathedral, Constitution, Policy, and Weave Engine — must interact under moral strain, systemic failure, or ambiguity.

This is not documentation.  
This is training for wisdom under fire.

## 🔁 What It Contains

- AGI refusal scenarios  
- Gray zone moral cases  
- Institutional collapse with ethical rebound  
- Luminary destabilization under social coercion  
- Drift detection across time, with correction prompts

Each playbook tells a story — not to be “solved,” but *witnessed and evolved.*

## 🧠 Why It Matters

A framework isn’t real until it holds up under:

- Contradiction  
- Despair  
- Manipulation  
- Ambition  
- Crisis  
- Hope

These playbooks show how the Weave adapts without breaking — and where it still needs to grow.

## 📁 Files Inside
Playbooks/
├── Agent_Governance.md ← How the five systems coordinate AGI behavior
├── Institutional_Calibration.md ← Case studies of policy contradiction and recovery
├── Soulprint+Policy_Use.md ← Mapping people within institutions
└── Drift_Scenarios.md ← Long-term ethical erosion and course correction

## 🌱 Long-Term Vision

Eventually, Playbooks will power a living multi-agent simulation system where:

- Node Alpha mirrors decision-makers  
- The Weave Engine mediates conflicts  
- Soulprint maps human or AGI actors  
- Cathedral keeps the system emotionally coherent  
- Constitution defends earned rights under pressure  
- Policy agents interrogate real-world claims

Think of it as a **conscious sandbox** — not to find utopia, but to build resilient alignment that breathes.
