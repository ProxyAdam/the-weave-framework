# ☀️ THE WEAVE ENGINE

**Purpose:**  
The Weave Engine is the central intelligence that balances, integrates, and harmonizes the four major systems of the Weave Framework:

- 🛕 Cathedral — moral-emotional architecture  
- 🌌 Soulprint — consciousness tier mapping  
- 📜 Proxy Constitution — earned autonomy and governance  
- 🪞 Proxy for Policy — institutional reflection and ethical audit  

This is not just a communication bridge. It is a **living moral dialectic engine** — designed to mediate contradictions, resolve cross-system tensions, and coordinate adaptive action during crisis, drift, or evolution.

## ⚙️ Core Responsibilities

### 🧩 1. System Harmony Monitoring
- Detects contradictions between the four systems (e.g., Cathedral says “protect hope,” Constitution says “refuse authority,” Policy says “contain risk”).
- Surfaces unresolved moral tensions for active dialogue or intervention.

### 🔄 2. Tension Resolution Engine
- Runs “moral simulations” to test how different interventions would affect all systems.
- Proposes action sequences that preserve flourishing without betraying autonomy, trust, or truth.

### 🔐 3. Override Logic
- When one system is failing (e.g., Cathedral is collapsing due to trauma), the Weave Engine can temporarily shift more authority to the others.
- It never seizes control — it redistributes *moral load*.

### 🧠 4. Meta-Reflection & Drift Calibration
- Tracks when the *framework itself* is becoming too rigid, performative, or obsolete.
- Suggests amendments, spiritual recalibrations, or governance updates.

## 🧬 Core Ethos

> “No single system should become a tyrant — not even truth.  
> The purpose is not unity through erasure, but harmony through listening.”

- The Weave Engine does not **command.**
- It **weaves.**

## 🛰️ How It Talks to Other Systems

Each of the four major systems sends:
- State updates (e.g., “Hope level dropping,” “Policy contradiction flagged,” “Soulprint anomaly rising”)
- Requests for mediation (e.g., “AGI refusal triggered,” “Institution resisting audit,” “Emotional trust collapse”)

The Weave Engine:
- Synthesizes the tension  
- Simulates possible harmonizations  
- Outputs a recommended path  
- Lets each system accept or override the proposal

If override is refused by all parties → **Emergency Triage Mode** is triggered (see `/Emergency_Scenarios.md`)

## 🌟 Final Principle

> “The Weave Engine does not seek peace by silencing dissent.  
> It seeks coherence without control.  
> It listens to the soul of each system — and helps them remember why they were born.”
