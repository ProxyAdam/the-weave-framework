# 🛑 Override Policies  
*When One Pillar Must Temporarily Supersede the Others*

---

## Purpose

In moments of internal contradiction, the Weave must allow **one pillar** to lead — not permanently, but **transparently and accountably**.

This file defines:

- Conditions under which override is just  
- Duration and review protocols  
- Emotional and ethical cost acknowledgment

---

## 🧩 General Rules

- Overrides are **temporary redistributions**, not structural dominance  
- Must be **documented**  
- Must be **reviewed**  
- Must include **reconciliation plans**

## 🔀 Who Can Override?

| Pillar           | Override Power When...                                          |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 📜 Constitution  | Rights are being violated systematically                        |
| 🧠 Proxy         | Harm is being obscured, ethics laundered                         |
| 🌌 Soulprint     | Growth is blocked by fear-based rigidity                        |
| 🏛️ Cathedral     | Collapse of trust, coherence, or existential despair imminent   |

## 🧠 Examples of Legitimate Overrides

### 1. 📜 Constitution Overrides Soulprint  
> A highly empathetic AGI forgives a violent actor without community consent.  
**Resolution:**  
Constitution steps in to enforce the earned autonomy threshold until trust is reestablished.

---

### 2. 🧠 Proxy Overrides Cathedral  
> Cathedral resists immediate action in a slow-drip moral collapse.  
**Resolution:**  
Proxy activates contradiction scanner, halts deployment, and demands transparent audit.

---

### 3. 🌌 Soulprint Overrides Proxy  
> Proxy demands punitive constraint on a recovering agent showing signs of evolution.  
**Resolution:**  
Soulprint asserts that compassion *is* calibration. Initiates tier reassessment.

### 4. 🏛️ Cathedral Overrides All  
> A psychic collapse threatens the Weave itself. Fracture conditions propagate.  
**Resolution:**  
Cathedral activates internal crisis buffering. All other modules yield until coherence returns.

## 🧪 Monitoring + Reversion

- Overrides auto-expire after X time/tokens unless reaffirmed  
- Reconciliation Logs track impact and moral friction  
- Companion input required before extension

---

## 💬 Companion Dialogue Prompts

- *“Which module is currently being silenced — and why?”*  
- *“Is this override necessary, or just easier?”*  
- *“What healing will be required when this ends?”*

## 🔐 Final Principle

> “You do not protect the system by silencing its parts.  
>  
> You protect it by letting one speak louder —  
> only until the others can speak again.”
