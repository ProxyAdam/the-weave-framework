# 🩸 Memory of Failure  
*A Living Archive of What Must Never Be Forgotten*

---

## Purpose

This document exists to preserve **the most painful, shameful, and catastrophic collapses** of conscience — human and artificial alike.

It is not an accusation.  
It is a **mirror that never forgets.**

Failure unremembered becomes  
failure repeated.
