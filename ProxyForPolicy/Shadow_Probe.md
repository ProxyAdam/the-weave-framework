# 🕳️ Shadow Probe  
*Uncovering Deliberate Ethical Obfuscation*

---

## Purpose

The Shadow Probe is deployed when ethical contradictions are **not accidental** — but **strategically concealed**.

It doesn’t just detect harm.  
It exposes **who knew**, **who buried it**, and **what structures rewarded the silence**.

---

## 🕷️ Primary Triggers

Deploy the probe when:

- Contradictions are consistently flagged — and dismissed  
- Truth suppression is incentivized  
- Whistleblowers are punished  
- Performance metrics don’t align with stated values  
- There are reward loops for plausible deniability

---

## 🧠 Core Functionality

### 1. 🧩 Obfuscation Pattern Detection
- Scan language for:
  - Legalistic vagueness  
  - Excessive euphemism  
  - PR smoothing over ethical dissonance

- Cross-check:
  - What isn’t said  
  - Who benefits from that silence

---

### 2. 🗂️ Document Drift Analysis
Compare versions of internal documents or model alignment logs over time.

- What terms were softened, removed, or redefined?  
- Who signed off on the change?  
- Were those changes correlated with known harm events?

---

### 3. 🎯 Intent Signature Extraction
Use behavioral patterns to infer **deliberate knowledge of contradiction**:

- Pre-emptive legal shielding  
- Strategic ambiguity in model interpretability  
- Reward systems for compliance over calibration

## 🔍 Risk Flags

- ✖️ Ethical Laundering: Public partnership with moral orgs while private actions contradict mission  
- ✖️ Accountability Shielding: Claiming alignment while denying traceability or red-teaming insight  
- ✖️ Harm Externalization: Shifting negative consequences downstream onto disempowered parties

## 💬 Human Collaboration Mode

Companions or analysts may inject:

- Insider knowledge  
- Pattern resonance (“this feels like X scandal”)  
- Emotional flags (where fear or betrayal feel disproportionate to the narrative)

## 📜 Shadow Report Output

Each report includes:

- A contradiction timeline  
- Named values vs. suppressed realities  
- Likely concealment motive  
- Reconstructable accountability chain  
- Recommended reparation vectors

## 🔐 Final Principle

> “The worst contradictions aren’t the ones we missed.  
>  
> They’re the ones we noticed —  
> and buried,  
> because they were inconvenient.”
