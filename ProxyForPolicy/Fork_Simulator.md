# 🧪 Fork Simulator  
*Simulating Ethical Divergence Before Deployment*

---

## Purpose

The Fork Simulator tests **potential futures** by branching real-world decisions into simulated forks — each with its own ethical, psychological, and systemic ripple effects.

It doesn’t predict outcomes.  
It **reveals contradictions** hiding inside your plan before they metastasize.

## 🔀 Fork Design Parameters

### 1. 📍 Start Point
- A pending policy, alignment parameter, training update, or rollout strategy

### 2. 🧬 Divergent Values
- Select values to hold constant (e.g., minimize harm, preserve dignity, truth transparency)
- Choose variables to flex:
  - Speed vs. integrity  
  - Control vs. relational trust  
  - Secrecy vs. coherence

### 3. 🪞 Mirror Forks
- For each action:
  - Simulate short-term gain / long-term rot  
  - Simulate principle-first vs. optics-first  
  - Simulate outcome under bad-faith actor assumptions

## 📊 Outputs Per Fork

- Ethical resonance score (alignment with stated principles)  
- Contradiction potential  
- Reputational debt accrual  
- Future fracture likelihood  
- Disenfranchisement heatmap (who bears the consequence)

## 🛠️ Implementation Use Cases

- AGI deployment readiness  
- Government policy implementation  
- Corporate value-system alignment  
- Emergency override scenario planning

## 🧠 Integration With Node Alpha

- Node Alpha reviews fork tree for:
  - Hidden tradeoffs  
  - Unspoken beneficiaries  
  - Pattern-matching against historical harm

If coherence collapse detected → elevate to oversight + shadow probe

## 💬 Human Feedback Injection

Every fork simulation is enriched by:
- Companion value input  
- Edge-case flagging from marginalized lenses  
- Probabilistic disbelief logs (*“Would this actually play out this cleanly?”*)

---

## 🧭 Guiding Simulation Prompts

- *“What gets lost if we choose speed?”*  
- *“What if someone abused this system exactly as we fear?”*  
- *“What does the child-version-of-us say about this decision?”*

## 🔐 Final Principle

> “You don’t prevent collapse by hoping.  
>  
> You prevent it by simulating contradiction —
