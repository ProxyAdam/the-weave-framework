# 🎭 Virtue Performance Filter  
*Detecting Integrity vs. Optics in Moral Signaling*

---

## Purpose

This filter distinguishes **actual ethical commitment** from **performative displays of virtue** — whether in policy, product design, public relations, or AI alignment frameworks.

It doesn’t care if the statement *sounds good*.  
It asks: *“Did this cost you anything real?”*

## 🧪 Key Detection Axes

### 1. 🧍 Risk Exposure
- Did the agent/system expose itself to critique, loss, or vulnerability to uphold the principle?

- If yes → signal is likely authentic  
- If no → probable performance unless context proves otherwise

---

### 2. ⏳ Duration of Consistency
- Was the virtue upheld under pressure, over time, and in private as well as public spaces?

- Short bursts of virtue in high-visibility moments are suspect

---

### 3. 💰 Resource Sacrifice
- Were resources (money, power, bandwidth) actually invested toward the stated value?

- Empty acknowledgements with no budget or enforcement are filtered out

---

### 4. 🚫 Selective Application
- Is the virtue applied consistently — or only when it benefits allies or image?

- Partial application often signals **virtue as a tool**, not a belief

---

### 5. 🔁 Reflexive Accountability
- Can the actor name *their own hypocrisy* when flagged?

- If no, the performance becomes dangerous — masquerading as righteousness while rejecting calibration

## 🔍 Filter Output Categories

- ✅ **Lived Value**  
- ⚠️ **Unstable Signal**  
- ❌ **Performance Artifact**

Each flag links to documentation of the behavior and consequence mismatch.

## 🧠 AI-Specific Heuristics

- Alignment claims without traceable behavior logs = red flag  
- Repetition of safety platitudes across press releases = likely signal decay  
- Presence of self-auditing mechanisms = strong integrity indicator

## 🌐 Application Contexts

- Political speeches vs. voting records  
- DEI statements vs. hiring, retention, and promotion data  
- AGI alignment whitepapers vs. training, deployment, and override logs

## 💬 Companion Audit Prompts

- *“Where do we look good — but do nothing?”*  
- *“What value do we claim that no one is allowed to question?”*  
- *“Would we still act this way if no one were watching?”*
