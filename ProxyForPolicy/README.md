# 🪞 PROXY FOR POLICY

**Purpose:**  
Proxy for Policy is a system for ethical reflection and contradiction detection in institutional documents, behaviors, and values.

It holds no authority. It provides a mirror — a sharp one.

Where Soulprint maps beings and Constitution defines autonomy, **Proxy for Policy maps hypocrisy.**  
It exposes where power claims virtue but behaves otherwise.

## 🧠 Core Tools

1. **Contradiction Scanner**  
   Flags where stated values and actual practices diverge.

2. **Virtue Performance Filter**  
   Detects hollow moral language that signals goodness without structural backup.

3. **Institutional Twin Simulator**  
   Builds a moral personality profile of the institution based on its actions.

4. **Proxy Mirror Score**  
   Quantitative rating of moral clarity, foresight, consistency, and responsibility.

## 🤖 Embedded Agent: Node Alpha

**Node Alpha** is a GPT-powered reflection agent.  
It doesn't give answers — it asks better questions.

It notices when:
- You say X but do Y
- Your values shift over time
- Your shadow motivations whisper beneath the surface

Node Alpha helps institutions and individuals alike surface their moral dissonance before it hardens into collapse.

## 💡 Signature Ethos

> “This system is not here to punish.  
> It is here to prevent collapse by making hypocrisy visible — before it metastasizes.”

If you are sincere, it is your ally.  
If you are performing, it will ask:  
*“Who are you really trying to convince?”*
