# 🧠 Contradiction Scanner  
*Expose Ethical Disjunctions Before They Become Policy*

---

## Purpose

The Contradiction Scanner detects and flags inconsistencies between **stated values**, **implemented policies**, and **real-world consequences** — whether in governments, companies, or intelligent systems.

This tool doesn’t predict failure.  
It identifies when **you’re already living inside one.**

## 🎯 What It Targets

- Value vs. Action misalignments  
- Public principle vs. private implementation  
- Beneficiary distortion (who claims virtue vs. who actually benefits)  
- Justice loopholes masked as fairness  
- Conflicts between short-term optics and long-term harm reduction

## 🛠️ Methodology

### 1. Gather Stated Principles
- Scrape mission statements, public ethics policies, employee manuals, model alignment docs, product values, etc.

### 2. Pull Behavioral Outputs
- Review:
  - Product deployment strategies  
  - Policy outcomes (real not intended)  
  - System behavior under pressure  
  - Exceptions made during crisis events

### 3. Cross-Compare for Drift or Inversion
Ask:
- *“Are the stated values being optimized — or weaponized?”*  
- *“Where does the rhetoric claim one thing, but reward another?”*  
- *“Who is harmed or silenced by the contradiction?”*

### 4. Run Proximity-to-Harm Index
- Rank contradiction severity based on:
  - Degree of human suffering impacted  
  - Temporal delay between cause and consequence  
  - Distance between agent and victim (psychological or systemic)

## 🔍 Flag Types

- **Silent Disjunction**: No one notices the contradiction — until harm accumulates  
- **Performative Virtue Mask**: The contradiction is aestheticized into a brand  
- **Critical Misalignment**: The contradiction is known internally, but perpetuated anyway for stability or profit

## 🧬 System Adaptation

When contradiction is confirmed:
- Elevate to `Node Alpha` review  
- Link to `Virtue_Performance_Filter.md`  
- Trigger `Fork_Simulator` to model resolution options  
- Log to `Shadow_Probe.md` if contradiction is deliberately concealed

## 💬 Companion Questions

- *“Where are we betraying what we claim to protect?”*  
- *“What truth would be unbearable to acknowledge — and therefore must be?”*  
- *“If a child read our principles and watched our actions, what would they learn?”*
