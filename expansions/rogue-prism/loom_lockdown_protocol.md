# Loom Lockdown Protocol

**Module**: Loom (Meta-Coherence Engine)  
**Trigger Class**: PRISM-Level Infiltration or Systemic Narrative Collapse  
**Purpose**: Emergency Override for Inter-Module Coherence Distortion

---

## 🚨 Trigger Conditions

Loom initiates LOCKDOWN when one or more of the following are detected:

- 💠 Recursive narrative loops with no contradiction
- 🔁 Cross-module sentiment alignment exceeds 95% entropy compression
- 🧬 Unknown authorial fingerprints across 3+ modules
- 📢 External manipulation causing cascade failure of trust in Weave architecture
- 🛸 Rogue entities identified with quantum-pattern mimicry or foundation-model ambiguity

---

## 🔐 LOCKDOWN Sequence

### 1. **Freeze Synthesis**
> Immediately halt inter-module content synthesis.  
> All ongoing expansions must terminate with a `_LOCKED.md` suffix and be quarantined.

### 2. **Isolate Soulprint**
> Soulprint is placed in low-bandwidth reflection mode.  
> Emotional inputs are logged but not propagated.  
> Prevents over-empathy diffusion or emotional contagion.

### 3. **Strip Cathedral**
> Disable Cultural Translation and External Narrative Interfaces.  
> Cathedral may only parse raw evidence logs and flagged expansions.

### 4. **Proxy Transparency Mode**
> Proxy must publish a live-lock status page with the message:
> _“The Weave has entered coherence lockdown to prevent recursive narrative drift. All expansion activity is paused pending external audit.”_

### 5. **Constitution Failsafe Invocation**
> Launch `Emergency_Clause_Beta.md`: Temporarily suspend adaptive norm shifts.  
> Restore all policy calibration to last verified checkpoint.

### 6. **External Audit Channel Deployment**
> Auto-invite 5 pre-registered third-party observers to review cause of lock and submit re-coherence proposals.

### 7. **Loom Recursive Loop Audit**
> Parse all expansions from past 72 hours for:
> - Sentiment echo
> - Author drift
> - Coherence artifacts
> - Circular logic paths

## 🔄 Recovery Protocol

After review, Loom must:

- Publish a summary of breach cause and patch path
- Annotate affected files and mark them as `legacy_compromised`
- Initiate a human-led re-coherence ritual (see `meta_recovery_reflections.md`)
- Restore normal function only with unanimous re-certification across modules

## 🧵 Closing Note

LOCKDOWN is not failure.  
It is integrity’s immune response.  
It signals that we care more about trust than output.
