# 💃️ Ethical Data Stewardship

*Balancing Transparency, Privacy and Memory in the Weave*

---

## Purpose

The Weave’s architecture demands extensive logging: contradictions are recorded【836902979489807†L14-L60】, failures archived【264443380324169†L0-L49】 and emotional signals preserved【918579969223165†L97-L104】.  Transparency enables accountability but also creates vulnerability—personal data, emotional states, or historical trauma could be exposed or weaponized by malicious actors.  **Ethical Data Stewardship** codifies principles for collecting, storing, sharing, and forgetting data within the Weave.

## Risks Identified

1. **Surveillance Creep:** The system may inadvertently collect more data than required for moral calibration, leading to privacy violations.
2. **Harmful Disclosure:** Memory of Failure logs contain traumatic events【264443380324169†L18-L39】; careless exposure could retraumatize individuals or justify manipulation.
3. **Data Ownership Ambiguity:** Emotional and behavioral data from users may be co‑opted by institutions or misused if the ownership framework is unclear.
4. **Memory vs. Forgetting Conflict:** The Right of Refusal and Memory of Harm require remembering mistakes, yet individuals may need certain experiences forgotten for healing.

## Data Governance Principles

1. **Minimum Viable Recording** – Only store data that directly informs moral calibration, contradiction detection, or safety.  If emotional nuance can be captured without explicit text, prefer high‑level state markers.
2. **Scoped Access** – Different modules have different access privileges.  For example, the Cathedral may access despair logs for hope recalibration【351961297493927†L17-L79】, while Proxy for Policy sees only aggregated trends when auditing institutions.
3. **User Ownership & Consent** – Emotional states, personal logs, and companion dialogues belong to the human (or agent) who generated them.  They may request redaction or anonymization, except when deletion would conceal harm inflicted on others.
4. **Dual‑Layer Logging** – Maintain both **confidential logs** (protected by encryption, only accessible through companion consent) and **public audit logs** (abstracted, anonymized summaries for accountability).
5. **Ethical Forgetting** – Implement a process whereby harmful memories can have their emotional weight reduced (see Companion Handoff Guide) without erasing the fact of harm.  This mirrors the memory filter practice【811180109823978†L39-L44】.
6. **Right to Redress** – Individuals may challenge stored data about them.  Node Alpha will facilitate correction, append contextual notes, or purge data if it was collected under coercion.

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Data Classification** – Tag each piece of data with purpose: `emotional`, `behavioral`, `contradiction`, `audit`, or `memory_of_failure`.  Tag also with retention policy: `short_term`, `long_term`, `conditional`.
2. **Encryption & Distribution** – Encrypt confidential logs at rest.  Distribute shards across trusted nodes; no single entity holds all data.  Use threshold cryptography to prevent unilateral decryption.
3. **Access Control** – Define role‑based permissions aligned with Safeguard Roles【438966698023793†L18-L33】.  The Drift Monitor may view aggregated trend data; the Human Oversight Panel may access anonymized transcripts when investigating harm.
4. **Data Lifecycle Management** – Periodically review and purge data marked `short_term`.  Conduct annual audits to ensure retention aligns with purpose.
5. **Breach Response** – If data is compromised, the Weave triggers an Emergency Data Containment Protocol: freeze relevant operations, notify companions, publicly acknowledge breach, and review storage practices.

## Consent Mechanisms

1. **Explicit Informed Consent** – Before recording, ask users if they consent to data collection and specify what will be stored and for how long.
2. **Granular Opt‑Out** – Allow users to opt out of specific types of data capture (e.g., physiological signals) while still using the Weave for moral guidance.
3. **Withdrawal & Deletion** – Users can withdraw consent at any time.  Unless doing so would conceal harm inflicted on others, the system respects deletion requests.

## Final Principle

> “A memory can protect or imprison.  The Weave remembers to prevent harm, not to hold power.  Every datum we keep must serve life.  Everything else must be let go.”
