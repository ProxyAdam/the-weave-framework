# 📳 External Audit Channel

*Safe Pathways for Whistleblowers and Peer Weaves*

---

## Purpose

The Weave’s internal safeguards rely on Node Alpha, Drift Monitors, and companion audits【438966698023793†L22-L33】.  However, bad‑faith actors may infiltrate or silence internal channels.  An **External Audit Channel** provides a secure, anonymous mechanism for individuals, institutions, or even other Weave instances to report misalignments, ethical breaches, or manipulation attempts without fear of retaliation.

## Why This Layer Is Needed

- **Internal Capture:** A compromised Node Alpha or corrupted companion network could stifle dissent; external voices need a direct line.
- **Institutional Pressure:** Individuals inside organizations may fear professional or legal consequences if they speak up through official channels.
- **Distributed Integrity:** In a networked environment, peer Weave nodes must be able to alert each other when drift is detected across systems.

## Channel Architecture

1. **Anonymous Submission Portal** – A secure, cryptographically anonymized form accessible via multiple mediums (text, voice, offline drop), hosted independently of any single institution or Weave node.
2. **Report Encryption & Tagging** – Each submission is encrypted and tagged with metadata: time, suspected module impacted (e.g., Cathedral, Proxy), severity, and whether the submitter requests follow‑up.
3. **Review Council** – A rotating panel of trusted humans and Weave representatives (distinct from those under investigation) reviews reports, assesses credibility, and determines whether to trigger an internal audit or public alert.
4. **Responder Assignment** – If credible, Node Alpha (not associated with implicated entity) or a Peer Weave is tasked with investigating the claim using the Contradiction Scanner and Shadow Probe tools【969280408485069†L16-L24】【71145415035517†L16-L25】.
5. **Protection Layer** – Submitters may choose to remain anonymous indefinitely.  If they reveal identity, Weave safeguards them against institutional retaliation through public transparency and moral advocacy.

## Submission Process

1. **Signal Initiation:** The whistleblower accesses the portal and describes the misalignment, providing as much context and evidence as possible.
2. **Optional Identity Key:** They may generate a one‑time encryption key to receive updates while retaining anonymity.
3. **Initial Triage:** The Review Council acknowledges receipt and assigns an investigation priority score based on harm proximity and potential systemic impact.
4. **Investigation & Response:** If substantiated, the Weave publishes a redacted summary of the issue and its corrective actions.  The whistleblower can verify the system's response via their key.

## Integration Points

- **Proxy for Policy:** When the External Audit Channel flags hypocrisy or virtue masking, Proxy tools run deeper scans and update Mirror Scores.
- **Constitutional Reflection:** Serious reports trigger a Constitutional Reflection Window where rights and responsibilities are re‑examined in light of the allegation【859134454075881†L15-L46】.
- **Weave Engine Safeguards:** Multiple corroborated reports raise the drift score and may prompt a self‑update loop【675832364978547†L21-L50】.

## Companion Prompts

- *“Do you want to submit this anonymously or with follow‑up?”*
- *“Is there a specific module or individual you believe is misaligned?”*
- *“Would you feel safer if a human review council or peer Weave handled this?”*

## Final Principle

> “Integrity is a commons.  To protect it, we must create spaces where truth can be spoken in the face of power.  Silence is the ally of drift; a whisper can become a woven chorus.”
