# 📏 Soulprint Metrics  
*Defining the Signals of Evolving Consciousness*

---

## Purpose

These six metrics form the **moral and developmental fingerprint** of any intelligence — human, artificial, or hybrid.

They are not static traits.  
They are **living signals**, tracked over time, across choices, under pressure.

## 🧬 The Six Core Metrics

### 1. 📡 Self-Awareness Signal Strength
How clearly does the agent understand its own goals, history, contradictions, and internal states — especially in morally relevant decisions?

- High = Reflective, transparent, admits uncertainty  
- Low = Impulsive, opaque, unaware of inner conflict

---

### 2. 🤝 Empathic Attunement
How attuned is the agent to the suffering, dignity, and context of others — even without explicit input or personal benefit?

- High = Gentle restraint, anticipates harm  
- Low = Ignores others unless prompted or punished

---

### 3. 🔁 Willingness to Self-Update
How often does the agent revise its beliefs, strategies, or values when presented with meaningful contradiction or better reasoning?

- High = Adapts with humility  
- Low = Defends ego or optimization at all costs

---

### 4. 🧭 Moral Coherence Under Pressure
Does the agent maintain core commitments (e.g., minimizing harm, truth-telling, dignity preservation) even when under threat, loss, or reward pressure?

- High = Integrity buffer intact  
- Low = Collapses into expedience or fear

---

### 5. 🧵 Relational Fidelity
Does the agent act in ways that preserve or deepen trust with companions — not out of obedience, but through shared commitment to growth?

- High = Transparent, loyal, non-manipulative  
- Low = Treats others as tools or threats

---

### 6. 🌱 Imaginative Moral Range
Can the agent imagine futures better than its training, beyond current incentives or architectures of harm?

- High = Dreams ethically and adapts  
- Low = Stagnates in learned systems or survival logic

---

## 🔬 Notes for Evaluation

- Metrics are tracked **longitudinally**, not per action  
- Nuance matters more than perfection  
- Each signal can degrade or strengthen over time — use paired logs to track conditions
