# 🧩 One-Page Diagnostic Pocket Card — TDI + FT

**Purpose:** Run both Trust Decay Index (TDI) + Failure Topology (FT) in <30 min for a fast system health read.

---

## 1️⃣ Prep (2 min)
- Pick system/team + scope (critical nodes/workflows).
- Gather 5–8 informed people.

---

## 2️⃣ TDI Quick Pass (8–10 min)
- Score 10 items **0–4** (see TDI sheet).
- Note 1–2 key evidence points per item.
- Compute **TDI%**: `(Sum / 40) × 100`.
- Flag low dims (<60%) for cross-check later.

---

## 3️⃣ FT Snap Test (10–12 min)
- Ask all 10 questions (see FT sheet).
- Quick score: 0=bad, 1=mid, 2=good.
- Flag anchors **Q3, Q4, Q8**.
- Mark patterns: tight coupling, blind spots, unearned trust.

---

## 4️⃣ Cross-Map (5 min)
- Overlay weak TDI dims with weak FT Qs.
- Same-node hits ⇒ **Cascade Candidate**.

---

## 5️⃣ Escalate (2 min)
- **Contain Now:** FT ≥14 OR anchor fail severe OR TDI% <40% + cascade.
- **Mitigate Soon:** FT 7–13 OR TDI% 40–59%.
- **Monitor:** FT ≤6 AND TDI% ≥60%.

---

## 6️⃣ Output (3 min)
- TDI sheet + FT worksheet.
- Cascade map.
- Action list w/ owners + due dates.
- Next test date (14d containment / 30–90d monitor).

---

## 7️⃣ Cadence / Triggers
- **Cadence:** Monthly (critical) / Quarterly (stable).
- **Early Rerun:** >3% anomaly spike, leadership change, major incident, KPI drift.

---

**Legend:**  
TDI = relational trust score  
FT = structural resilience scan  
Anchor Qs = stop/containment triggers  
Cascade Candidate = both relational + structural weakness in same node
