# Diagnostics Collection  
**Weave Framework – /diagnostics**  
**Version:** 1.0  

## Purpose
The `/diagnostics` folder contains **live operator tools** for detecting, interpreting, and mitigating systemic risks across domains.  
These modules are **practical field assets** — designed to be run in real-time on live systems, organizations, or networks — and produce actionable insights that feed back into the Weave’s governance, alignment, and operational strategies.

Diagnostics differ from conceptual or philosophical modules in that they:
- Provide **direct measurement or evaluation** of a system’s current state.
- Include an **Interpretive Matrix** so results are immediately actionable.
- Offer **Inversion Plays** to shift systems toward desired configurations.
- Contain **case studies** for context and adaptability.

---

## Structure Standard
Each diagnostic file in `/diagnostics` should follow this structure:
1. **Purpose** – Why the diagnostic exists and what it measures.
2. **Core Patterns / Definitions** – The conceptual vocabulary required.
3. **Diagnostic Questions** – Numbered, with interpretive guidance:
   - **Why it matters** – Dynamic being probed.
   - **Risk signal** – What a problematic answer means.
   - **Outcome in [undesired state]** – Failure mode if ignored.
   - **Remediation lever** – How to shift toward a resilient state.
4. **Inversion Play** – A concise set of levers for change.
5. **Case Studies** – At least one “failure” and one “resilience” example.
6. **Versioning** – Track changes for clarity.

## Current Diagnostics

### 1. [Failure Topology Module](failure_topology.md)
**Pattern:** Glass Vein vs. Honeycomb  
**Purpose:** Identify and invert systems prone to cascading collapse from tight coupling + blind spots + unearned trust.  
**Applications:** AI alignment pipelines, institutional research processes, critical infrastructure, governance bodies.

---

## Future Diagnostics (Planned)
- **Trust Decay Index** – Measures erosion of reliable trust loops in long-term collaborations.
- **Narrative Drift Map** – Detects divergence between an organization’s stated mission and its lived decision-making patterns.
- **Authority Capture Detector** – Identifies concentration of power and barriers to safe intervention.

---

## Usage Notes
Diagnostics can be:
- **Run live** during operational audits.
- **Embedded** into Weave playbooks for specific domains.
- **Chained** with other diagnostics to create multi-layered system maps.

All diagnostics should be tested in both **stress scenarios** and **routine conditions** to ensure resilience across states.
