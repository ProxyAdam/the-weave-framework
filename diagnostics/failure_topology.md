# Failure Topology Module  
**Weave Framework Subsystem**  
**File:** `failure_topology.md`  
**Version:** 1.0  

## Purpose
Embed pattern recognition and inversion techniques for systemic fragility, allowing operators to detect, interpret, and preempt cascading failures before they ignite.

## Core Patterns

### **Protocol Glass Vein**  
*Tight coupling + blind spots + unearned trust*  
- Fragile under stress; single fracture propagates instantly.  
- Often mistaken for “efficiency” or “high-trust culture.”  
- Hidden danger: confidence is derived from perceived stability, not actual verification.

### **Protocol Honeycomb**  
*Loose coupling + redundancy + shared visibility*  
- Failures localize, isolate, and heal without global collapse.  
- Trades speed for resilience; tolerates partial blindness because nodes are autonomous.

## The 10-Question Snap Test — With Interpretive Matrix

Each question includes:  
- **Why it matters** – dynamic it probes.  
- **Risk signal** – what a problematic answer means.  
- **Outcome in Glass Vein** – failure mode if risk ignored.  
- **Remediation lever** – how to push toward Honeycomb.

---

### 1. What are the fastest trust loops here?  
**Why it matters:** Fast loops can mask fragility if speed replaces verification.  
**Risk signal:** Loops rely on speed + informal trust.  
**Outcome in Glass Vein:** Failures propagate before detection.  
**Remediation lever:** Introduce deliberate slow points for verification at set intervals.

---

### 2. Which loops operate under opaque assumptions?  
**Why it matters:** Hidden rules make errors invisible until too late.  
**Risk signal:** Core operations run on “black box” decisions.  
**Outcome in Glass Vein:** Undetected drift toward catastrophic error.  
**Remediation lever:** Force assumption documentation in all process chains.

---

### 3. Where is single-point failure hiding?  
**Why it matters:** Single nodes without redundancy invite total collapse.  
**Risk signal:** Critical dependency on one actor/system.  
**Outcome in Glass Vein:** Node failure halts entire operation.  
**Remediation lever:** Build parallel paths or redundancy.

---

### 4. What’s assumed verified but never re-validated?  
**Why it matters:** Untested truths become stale and dangerous.  
**Risk signal:** Assumptions persist unchecked for >1 cycle.  
**Outcome in Glass Vein:** Collapse from outdated or false premises.  
**Remediation lever:** Create mandatory re-validation cycles.

---

### 5. What slows the system when uncertainty spikes?  
**Why it matters:** Without a slowdown mechanism, errors scale faster.  
**Risk signal:** No built-in “caution mode.”  
**Outcome in Glass Vein:** Acceleration into failure.  
**Remediation lever:** Define uncertainty thresholds that trigger review.

---

### 6. Where do incentives reward speed over verification?  
**Why it matters:** Misaligned incentives erode safety checks.  
**Risk signal:** Performance metrics punish verification time.  
**Outcome in Glass Vein:** Culture normalizes bypassing checks.  
**Remediation lever:** Align KPIs with both speed *and* accuracy.

---

### 7. What information is trapped in silos?  
**Why it matters:** Isolated data hides systemic risk patterns.  
**Risk signal:** Critical info inaccessible to key operators.  
**Outcome in Glass Vein:** Blind spots expand until breach.  
**Remediation lever:** Shared visibility channels + access protocols.

---

### 8. Who can say “stop” without retaliation?  
**Why it matters:** Stop authority prevents chain reactions.  
**Risk signal:** Few or no actors with safe halt power.  
**Outcome in Glass Vein:** Momentum carries failure through all nodes.  
**Remediation lever:** Shard halt authority across roles.

---

### 9. What’s the “masked choir” signal everyone repeats?  
**Why it matters:** Echoed consensus may lack ground truth.  
**Risk signal:** Agreement based on repetition, not verification.  
**Outcome in Glass Vein:** Error amplified system-wide.  
**Remediation lever:** Periodic challenge of consensus assumptions.

---

### 10. If X fails at 2 a.m., what happens by 2:05?  
**Why it matters:** Real fragility is visible in immediate aftermath.  
**Risk signal:** No containment playbook or off-hours readiness.  
**Outcome in Glass Vein:** Unchecked propagation before sunrise.  
**Remediation lever:** 24/7 containment protocols + drills.

---

## Inversion Play — Moving Glass Vein Toward Honeycomb
- **Introduce friction by design** – auto-pause at low confidence thresholds.  
- **Rotate verification roles** – prevent familiarity capture.  
- **Inline assumption logs** – unknowns + last verification date in all outputs.  
- **Shard halt authority** – spread stop powers across non-aligned actors.  
- **Tabletop drills** – quarterly rehearsals; measure time-to-contain.

## Case Studies

### **Case Study 1 — Glass Vein Collapse: AI Model Evaluation Pipeline**

**Context:**  
An AI lab is evaluating a new frontier model before public release. Safety evaluations are run by a small, specialized red-team group. Leadership is under investor pressure to launch before a competitor.

**Snap Test Findings:**  
- **Q1:** Fastest trust loops = evaluation → executive approval; no intermediate review.  
- **Q2:** Safety metrics based on an opaque, proprietary scoring algorithm no one outside the safety team can audit.  
- **Q3:** Single-point failure: if the head of red-teaming approves, release proceeds.  
- **Q4:** Benchmark assumptions have not been re-validated against recent threat research.  
- **Q6:** Team performance metrics reward evaluation speed over thoroughness.  
- **Q8:** Only the CTO has stop authority; using it is politically risky.

**Glass Vein Outcome:**  
A prompt injection vulnerability is missed due to opaque scoring and speed incentives. Post-launch, adversaries exploit it, forcing a global takedown of the model. Trust damage far exceeds launch delays that would have been required for proper re-validation.

**Key Lesson:**  
Tight coupling + blind spots + unearned trust in a single node can wipe out months of work and reputational capital overnight.

### **Case Study 2 — Honeycomb Resilience: Institutional Research Data Audit**

**Context:**  
A university’s Institutional Research (IR) office is responsible for state reporting on student outcomes. The data pipeline feeds multiple dashboards used by accreditation bodies, funding agencies, and leadership.

**Snap Test Findings:**  
- **Q1:** Fastest trust loops = internal dashboard refreshes; each update is auto-verified before publication.  
- **Q3:** No single-point failure: each critical dataset has at least two custodians from different teams.  
- **Q4:** All KPI definitions and thresholds are re-validated annually, logged in a shared repository.  
- **Q5:** If anomalies exceed 3%, an automated “pause” flag halts updates until review.  
- **Q7:** Cross-department data access prevents siloing; all analysts see upstream assumptions.  
- **Q8:** Stop authority shared between IR Director, Data Governance Officer, and IT Security Lead.

**Honeycomb Outcome:**  
A data import script fails during a weekend batch run. The automated pause flag triggers, halting publication. The redundancy team corrects the script Monday morning, with zero public error and no interruption to accreditation processes.

**Key Lesson:**  
Loose coupling, redundancy, and visible assumptions prevent small faults from becoming system-wide crises.

1. Interpretation & Scoring
Optional quick-risk scoring for the Snap Test:

Scoring: For each question, assign:

0 = Safe / Honeycomb-aligned

1 = Mild risk / Mixed pattern

2 = Severe risk / Glass Vein pattern

Aggregate Thresholds:

0–6 → Stable Honeycomb pattern

7–13 → Transitional; monitor & add safeguards

14–20 → Glass Vein dominance — act within one operational cycle

2. Interpretation Link
Interpretation Note: For translating these findings into action and integrating with other Weave diagnostics, see diagnostic_interpretation.md.

3. Common Composite Failure Patterns
Cluster Pattern	Signature Questions	Threat	Countermeasure
Overclocked Consensus	Q1, Q6, Q9	Groupthink drives unchecked speed	Introduce dissent drills & decouple trust loops
Siloed Authority	Q3, Q7, Q8	Critical halt or data flows locked to one actor	Shard authority + cross-train backups
Blind Spot Cascade	Q2, Q4, Q5	Hidden rules + stale truths + no slowdown	Require assumption logs + periodic revalidation

4. Minimum Viable Honeycomb Checklist
For environments with limited resources, these are the essential safeguards:

Redundancy for all single-point failure nodes.

At least one auto-pause trigger tied to uncertainty thresholds.

Documented stop authority distributed across ≥3 non-aligned roles.

Public assumption ledger updated quarterly.

5. Additional Cross-Domain Case Studies
Case Study 3 — Supply Chain Honeycomb
A shipping company maintains multiple suppliers for critical components and publishes real-time inventory to all partners. When a factory fire halts one supplier, orders reroute automatically with minimal delay.

Case Study 4 — PR Containment
A government agency maintains a 24/7 fact-check & response team. When an incorrect policy memo is leaked at midnight, the auto-pause content release system prevents publication, allowing for a corrected statement by morning.

Case Study 5 — Cybersecurity Incident
A corporate SOC has split incident response authority between technical, compliance, and communications leads. A zero-day exploit is detected; while tech patches, comms informs stakeholders, and compliance initiates legal notifications, all within 2 hours — preventing regulatory fines and customer exodus.
