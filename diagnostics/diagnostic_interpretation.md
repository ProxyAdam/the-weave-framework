# Diagnostic Interpretation & Action Guide

This guide explains how to interpret responses to the core Weave Framework diagnostics and turn them into actionable next steps. It applies to all diagnostic modules, including the **Trust Decay Index (TDI)**, **Failure Topology**, and any bespoke assessments.

## 1. Reading the Results

1. **Score-Based Diagnostics**  
   - Many tools (e.g., TDI) produce a *numeric score* or weighted index.  
   - Higher scores typically mean **greater stability and trust**.  
   - Lower scores indicate **critical vulnerabilities** that require immediate intervention.

2. **Pattern-Based Diagnostics**  
   - In qualitative diagnostics (e.g., `failure_topology.md`), patterns in responses matter more than totals.  
   - Look for *clusters of weakness* in related domains (e.g., moral alignment AND resilience both trending low).

3. **Anchor Question Flags**  
   - Some questions are "anchor questions" — failure here overrides otherwise good scores.  
   - Example: A high TDI but "No" on *"Is moral override functioning?"* = **Red Alert**.

## 2. Interpretation Framework

| Diagnostic Outcome | Interpretation | Consequence Level | Recommended Action |
|--------------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| High Trust, High Resilience | System is stable, relationships strong | Low | Maintain cadence of light monitoring |
| High Trust, Low Resilience | Strong relationships but brittle under stress | Medium | Introduce resilience drills, failover simulations |
| Low Trust, High Resilience | Capable of surviving crises but lacks cohesion | Medium | Invest in trust-building and transparency |
| Low Trust, Low Resilience | At risk of collapse under strain | High | Immediate crisis intervention and leadership alignment |

## 3. Recommended Actions

- **Low Trust Indicators**  
  - Increase cross-node communication.
  - Deploy *Companion Loyalty Webs* to repair relational bonds.
  - Remove bottlenecks where one node hoards decision-making authority.

- **Low Resilience Indicators**  
  - Activate *Crisis Self-Patching* exercises.
  - Run stress tests simulating sustained disruption.
  - Diversify dependency points in infrastructure.

- **Moral Override Failure**  
  - Invoke *Moral Dreamspace* workshops.
  - Freeze high-impact decisions until alignment is restored.

## 4. Case Studies

### Case Study A — "The Silent Collapse"
**Pattern:**  
- Trust Decay Index dropped by 40% in 2 weeks.
- High performance in resilience drills masked relational fractures.
**Outcome:**  
- During a minor ethical dispute, the entire decision-making council fractured along loyalty lines.
**Lesson:**  
- High resilience without trust means the group survives events mechanically but not socially.

### Case Study B — "The Paper Shield"
**Pattern:**  
- TDI stable, but failure_topology flagged brittle comms infrastructure.
- Several anchor questions revealed "No" on override and conflict resolution readiness.
**Outcome:**  
- In an actual misinformation cascade, the framework's playbooks were unused because nobody trusted who should trigger them.
**Lesson:**  
- Stability metrics mean little if operational trust in tools is missing.

### Case Study C — "The Quiet Immunity"
**Pattern:**  
- Low initial trust, but resilience mechanisms tested exceptionally high.
- Frequent minor disruptions had been used to train adaptive responses.
**Outcome:**  
- When a major alignment challenge hit, the team adapted quickly and trust followed from results.
**Lesson:**  
- Sometimes resilience can precede and then grow trust — the order can matter.

## 5. Usage Notes

- Always combine **quantitative** (scores) and **qualitative** (observations) results before deciding actions.
- Look for changes over **time** — trendlines are more important than one-off results.
- Flag any anchor question failures for **immediate** review, regardless of other outcomes.

6. Failure Topology Integration
When interpreting Failure Topology Snap Test results, use both the pattern identity (Glass Vein vs. Honeycomb) and the cluster patterns (e.g., Overclocked Consensus, Siloed Authority, Blind Spot Cascade).

Scoring Guidance (if applied):

0–6 → Stable Honeycomb pattern: Maintain existing safeguards; monitor at normal cadence.

7–13 → Transitional state: Add friction to fast trust loops, shard stop authority, and revalidate assumptions before next operational cycle.

14–20 → Glass Vein dominance: Deploy immediate containment protocols, initiate redundancy buildout, and reconfigure incentives within one cycle.

Anchor Questions for Failure Topology:

Q3 (Single-Point Failure), Q4 (Assumptions Never Re-Validated), Q8 (Stop Authority Without Retaliation)

Any “Glass Vein” answer to these should be treated as an automatic High consequence level, regardless of total score.

7. Cross-Module Correlation
If Failure Topology and another module (e.g., Trust Decay Index) both flag the same node/actor:

Escalate to critical path intervention — this is a probable cascade ignition point.

Apply both relational (trust repair) and structural (resilience building) interventions in parallel.

8. Rapid Containment Playbook (Optional Add-On)
When a Failure Topology scan scores ≥14 or trips any anchor question:

Pause high-impact ops for the affected node/system.

Isolate failure vector (technical or human) within one operational day.

Deploy redundancy — assign backup roles, mirror data/processes.

Rebuild trust loop via joint verification sessions.

Re-run Snap Test within 14 days to confirm mitigation.
